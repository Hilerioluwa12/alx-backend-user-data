Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields
How to encrypt a password and check the validity of an input password
How to authenticate to a database using environment variables

0. Regex-ing
mandatory
Write a function called filter_datum that returns the log message obfuscated:

Arguments:
fields: a list of strings representing all fields to obfuscate
redaction: a string representing by what the field will be obfuscated
message: a string representing the log line
separator: a string representing by which character is separating all fields in the log line (message)
The function should use a regex to replace occurrences of certain field values.
filter_datum should be less than 5 lines long and use re.sub to perform the substitution with a single regex.

2. Create logger
mandatory
Use user_data.csv for this task

Implement a get_logger function that takes no arguments and returns a logging.Logger object.

The logger should be named "user_data" and only log up to logging.INFO level. It should not propagate messages to other loggers. It should have a StreamHandler with RedactingFormatter as formatter.

Create a tuple PII_FIELDS constant at the root of the module containing the fields from user_data.csv that are considered PII. PII_FIELDS can contain only 5 fields - choose the right list of fields that can are considered as “important” PIIs or information that you must hide in your logs. Use it to parameterize the formatter.
